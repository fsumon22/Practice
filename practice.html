       <h2> See you not for mind</h2>
       <p>While being online 24/7 is not always great, the list of ways that you can entertain yourself through the web is practically endless. On top of social media sites, there are also tons of funny blogs to read when you're bored.

        To put it in perspective: everyone reading this article has probably heard of The Oatmeal, Fail Blog, or The Onion at least once.
        
        However, one thing all these websites have in common is that they are immensely popular, and need little introduction. A lot of them also rely on images instead of text in order to give you a laugh </p>

            An account of Rusesabagina's actions during the genocide was later dramatised in the film Hotel Rwanda directed by Terry George, in which he was portrayed by American actor Don Cheadle.[7] The film has been the subject both of critical acclaim and deep controversy, particularly in Rwanda.[8][9]
            
            On the back of newly-found international fame, Rusesabagina embarked on a successful career as a public speaker, mostly touring universities in the United States.[10] He campaigns for the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation, which he founded in 2006.[3][11] He holds Belgian citizenship, and a U.S. green card, and has homes in Brussels, Belgium and San Antonio, Texas.[1]
